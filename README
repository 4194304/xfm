This repository is a very small few patches to get xfm to compile on Void Linux, and
I have no guarantees if it'll work on Arch or other distros. I have it so it compiles 
with normal Xaw (2d Xaw like what xfontsel uses), but you can uncomment the lines for 
Xaw3d if you want to do that.

This is the original description from the project's README:

For the latest information and sources please visit the xfm homepage at
http://www.musikwissenschaft.uni-mainz.de/~ag/xfm/. Installation instructions
can be found in the INSTALL file (who would have guessed that ;-)).

This is a powerful file and applications manager program written using the X
toolkit. It contains virtually all of the features that you would expect in a
file manager -- move around your directory tree in multiple windows, and move,
copy or delete files with simple mouse operations. Directory displays are
updated automatically in regular intervals when the contents of a displayed
directory changes. The integrated application manager allows you to load files
into your favourite applications from the file manager by dragging icons. It
can also be used as a "shelf" onto which you can place files and directories
you are currently working with. A special LOAD action for application files
enables you to manage different application groups.

User-definable file types allow you to specify a command to be executed when
double-clicking on a file or dropping other files onto it. The command can
also prompt you for required parameters. Xfm makes it easy to configure
special kinds of actions such as, e.g., replacing the contents of a compressed
tar archive with a collection of selected files. A lot of corresponding
examples can be found in the distribution, including a fully functional
trashcan feature. Last not least, xfm can automatically mount and unmount
special devices like floppies as you open and close the corresponding
directories (mount points). So you won't have to fiddle around with mount or
mtools commands any more if all you want to do is copy some files between the
hard disk and your floppy drive.

I think that this program compares well to other free -- and even commercial
-- file managers. It is fast, convenient to use, and offers a lot of built-in
functionality and configuration options. If you are not addicted to the shell
and like to shuffle around files with one hand in order to perform tasks such
as moving, copying, deleting, compiling, formatting, archiving, compressing,
etc. etc., then xfm is certainly for you.

The original version of this program was written by Simon Marlow at the
University of Glasgow. I included Simon's README for reference purposes; see
README-1.2. [Most of the information in this file is outdated; please refer to
this README file and the man page for up-to-date installation and usage
instructions.]

Release 1.3 stemmed from my efforts to resolve some nasty bugs in the 1.2 beta
version distributed with Linux slackware, and to add XPM support for displaying
color icons in the file and application windows. As it came out, I also added a
plethora of other features to make xfm the tool I was looking for; see the
ChangeLog for details.

Release 1.3.1 added an automatic shell detection feature, which has been
contributed by Robert Vogelgesang (vogelges@rhrk.uni-kl.de). We hope that this
transparently fixes the problems with different shell argument passing
conventions which have been encountered with release 1.3. The configuration
files supplied with the package should now work with any popular shell -- if
not, set the new X resource Xfm.BourneShells; see the man page for details.

Release 1.3.2 added a bunch of new features; the most important are listed
below:

* Improved support for creating symbolic links. The Link option now works
  completely analogous to the Copy option; in particular, it is now possible
  to create links for a selected set of files in a specified directory.

* Rearranging items in the application window, which used to be a pain in
  earlier releases, is now a lot easier. Items in the application window
  can now be moved and copied using drag and drop, and cut/copy/paste gives a
  convenient way to move entries between different application files. There
  also is a new option for installing application groups, and the Back and
  Main buttons allow to navigate in the application group tree.

* "Magic headers," contributed by Juan D. Martin (juando@cnm.us.es). With
  this feature it is now possible to identify file types by their mode and
  contents in addition to the filename patterns. This is implemented using
  a "magic" file format (see magic(5)) with some important extensions like
  mode checking and regular expression matching. It also allows you to specify
  custom icons for directories and executables in file windows. A sample
  magic file is included. Also, Juan wrote a tiny program named xfmtype which
  lets you determine the xfm magic type of a file.

* A Filter option for the View menu, contributed by Kevin Rodgers
  (rodgers@lvs-emh.lvs.loral.com). This nice function allows you to restrict
  the set of files  displayed in a file window -- for instance, only display
  *.c files.

* A View option for the file popup menu (accompanied by a VIEW action which
  can be used in push actions), contributed by Scott Heavner
  (sdh@falstaff.MAE.cwru.edu). This option works analogous to the Edit
  option, but invokes a program for viewing a file (e.g. xless, available
  from ftp.x.org).

* Default values in parameter dialogs, contributed by Brian King
  (ender@ee.WPI.EDU). Using the %parameter--value% notation, you can now
  specify default values for parameters in push and drop actions.

* Lots of new icons, and a new set of standard config files. Juan D. Martin
  has compiled a comprehensive collection of fileicons. Take a look at the
  contrib/fileicons directory.
 
* Besides this, I cleaned up the source tree, fixed some bugs, overhauled
  Imakefiles and added an "Imake.options" file for easier customization.

Release 1.4 is mostly the work of Till Straumann from the Technical University
of Berlin. He's done a marvellous job. Here are the most important
user-visible changes (please refer to Till's README-1.4 for further details):

* xfm now starts in the cwd instead of the user's home directory

* the performance of the file view has been improved considerably; it's really
  impressive, especially if you're displaying directories with hundreds of
  files

* the scrollbar position is retained during updates (everybody's favourite
  fix ;-))

* keyboard shortcuts for most menu operations and dialog buttons, improved
  scrolling text fields in dialogs

* path history menu

* log window for output of child processes

* a new "shellCommand" resource now allows you to set the shell to be used for
  invoking commands independently from the SHELL environment variable

* text display, file info and permissions now include the suid/sgid/sticky
  bits

* X selection support: it is now possible to paste the paths of the selected
  file items (as strings) to other applications using the XA_PRIMARY
  selection

* many bug fixes

I also added some of my own favourite patches:

* bug fixes in copy operation (patch contributed by Walt Killjoy
  (ngogn@clark.net)) and magic headers code (patch by Juan D. Martin)

* transparently move files between different file systems (via copy/del)

* new Rename and Xterm operations (inspired by moxfm), and an "About" dialog
  which displays a logo and version information

* current path/application file name is shown in window titles

* at startup, prompt user to run xfm.install if the .xfm dir does not yet
  exist (every sysadmin's favourite change ;-))

* an improved setup featuring additional file types and spiffy new 3d-look
  icons (see the contrib/3dicons dir)


Enjoy!
