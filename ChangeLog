2001-09-03  root  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	Release 1.4.3

	* fixed some bugs in magic.c (patch snapped from xplore), updated
	magic files accordingly (*NOTE*: this might break older setups,
	so make sure you update your personal magic file!)

	* added Bob Woodside's double click patch for the application
	window (FmAw.c)

2000-05-11  Till Straumann <Till.Straumann@TU-Berlin.de>

    Patchlevel 1.4.2patchl05

    * fixed problems with `kwm' hanging on session logout.
      We now participate to the WM_SAVE_YOURSELF protocol
      (and even set KWM_SAVE_YOURSELF if kwm seems to be running).
    * fixed the `ugly text display of long group names' problem which
      occurred when a text display list contained only one entry [..]

2000-01-17  Albert Graef  <ag@muwiinfa.geschichte.uni-mainz.de>

	Patchlevel 1.4.2patchl04
	
	* added some trivial changes to fix compilation probs on SuSE
	Linux 6.3 and Solaris 2.x, and tweaked some of the resources in
	Xfm.cpp (nicer selection color, no borders on labels in dialogs
	when using Xaw3d)

	* updated ChangeLog

2000-01-17  Till Straumann <Till.Straumann@tu-berlin.de>

	Patchlevel 1.4.2patchl03
	
	This patch fixes a couple of bugs in 1.4.2:

	* xfm sometimes crashed when creating a text display
	(e.g. by cloning a text display or setting the
	`defaultDisplayType' or `initialDisplayType' resources).

	* the `options' menu button disappeared when the text display was
	updated.

	* double clicks in the file window finally work in ol[v]wm/kwm
	even if the focus policy is "click to focus" (app window still
	needs to be fixed)

	* popup windows didn't handle the WM_DELETE_WINDOW protocol.

	* the `-version' option should work and show the release number as
	well as the patchlevel.

	* The `TextField: cursor position out of range' warnings should
	have gone. TextField has been used for other apps and has got a
	couple of new features (currently not used by xfm).

	* moved installation instructions to a separate `INSTALL' file
	
Oct 1997  Albert Graef (ag@muwiinfa.geschichte.uni-mainz.de)

        some additional patches for Till's 1.4 version

	* bug fixes in copy operation (patch contributed by Walt Killjoy
  	(ngogn@clark.net)) and magic headers code (patch by Juan
 	D. Martin)

	* transparently move files between different file systems (via
 	copy/del)

	* new Rename and Xterm operations (inspired by moxfm)

	* current path/application file name is shown in window titles

	* at startup, prompt user to run xfm.install if the .xfm dir does
 	not yet exist

	* added a new 3d icon set (see contrib/3dicons)

	* updated the manpage

Jul-Oct 1997  Till Straumann (strauman@sun6hft.ee.tu-berlin.de)

	new version 1.4 with lots of bug fixes and enhancements (see
 	README-1.4 for details)

Mar-Apr 1995  Albert Graef (ag@muwiinfa.geschichte.uni-mainz.de)

	Release 1.3.2

	* integrated various contributions: magic file type detection (Juan D.
	Martin, juando@cnm.us.es), filter option (Kevin Rodgers,
	rodgers@lvs-emh.lvs.loral.com), view option (Scott Heavner,
	sdh@falstaff.MAE.cwru.edu) and default values in parameter dialogs
	(Brian King, ender@ee.WPI.EDU)

	* fixed a memory leak in .FmOps.copydir(), and some annoying bugs in
	.FmFw.createTreeDisplay(), .FmFwCb.mainArrowCb() and
	.FmAw.replaceApplication()

	* added default values to all standard dialogs (everybody's favorite
	trivial change ;-), and, since I was too lazy to implement an "About"
	box, a -version option which causes xfm	to print its version number
	and exit

	* improved support for creating symbolic links, and added a Link
	option to the file popup menu; these options now work analogous to the
	corresponding Copy options

	* removed the autoSave resource and the Save setup option; application
	files are now always saved automatically upon each modification of the
	application window (this has become necessary since manipulating the
	applications window is now a lot easier; see below); a Reload option
	still lets you edit application files with a text editor and reload
	the applications file while xfm is running

	* added an option to install application groups (which is a simplified
	version of the general application install option)

	* an application file stack; the Back and Main options allow you
	to navigate in your application group tree, and make explicit "back"
	items in the application window unnecessary

	* drag and drop in the application window; it is now possible to move
	and copy items in the application window by simply dragging a selected
	set of items to a new place

	* cut/copy/paste of application items; this finally gives a convenient
	way to move items in the application window between different
	application files

	* added "Select all" and "Deselect all" options to the application
	menu

	* buttons with Back, Main, Reload and File window options at the
	bottom of the application window

	* additions to the Imakefile and Xfm.cpp for optional linking with
	Xaw3d (suggested by Simon Marlow)

	* removed obsolete xfmc subdir, cleaned up the source directory tree,
	overhauled Imakefiles, and added an "Imake.options" file for easier
	customization

	* renamed the standard application files (note that xfm applications
	files are now recognized in xfm by the "#XFM" header, thanks to the
	magic types added by Juan D. Martin; so the rigid "xfm-*" naming
	scheme of earlier 1.3.x releases is no longer required)

	* added lots of icons (a large collection of fileicons was donated by
	Juan D. Martin), and overhauled the standard config files

	* updated documentation

Feb 1995  Robert Vogelgesang (vogelges@rhrk.uni-kl.de)

	Release 1.3.1

	Some minor portability fixes for AIX.


Dec 1994  Albert Graef (ag@muwiinfa.geschichte.uni-mainz.de)

	* bug fixes:
	  - initialize parameter dialog fields
	  - handle \% in push and drop actions
	  - invoke executable with absolute pathname
	    (.FmFwActions.fileExecFile())
	  - fixed buggy use of alloca in FmAw.c; added casts to (char *) to
	    all invokations of alloca
	  - fixed "interrupted system call" error in shell auto-detection (fix
	    suggested by Simon Marlow)

	* applied some portability patches

	* added some icons (in particular, note that the applications window
	  has a new icon, xfm_appmgr.xpm, which now has the same size as the
	  file window icon; the "button bar" icon, which used to be in
	  xfm_appmgr.xpm, is now in apps.xpm)

	* some cosmetic changes and bug fixes in configuration, make, and
	  documentation files

Nov 1994  Robert Vogelgesang (vogelges@rhrk.uni-kl.de)

	Release 1.3.1 beta

	* fixed some minor bugs, in particular initialization of file types
	  in text display

	* code cleanup; updated documentation. 	

	One problem remains unsolved: sometimes when you start xfm, it
	won't come up, but print a message like:
	`Reading child's output failed: interrupted system call'
	It's my Bourne Shell test which outputs this message. If you get
        this message, please retry starting xfm, and if that doesn't
	work, you can disable the test by defining the X resource
        Xfm.BourneShells -- see the man page for details.
	Albert gets this on a Sun running Solaris, but I cannot reproduce
	it under Linux, and therefore wasn't able to fix it.
	Maybe you are. Please email any fixes (or further bug reports)
	either to Albert or to me. 

Sep 1994  Robert Vogelgesang (vogelges@rhrk.uni-kl.de)

	* added resource `*BourneShells' and shell type detection.

Apr 1994  Albert Graef (ag@muwiinfa.geschichte.uni-mainz.de)

	Release 1.3 with many bug fixes and enhancements, too numerous to list
	them all. The most important user-visible changes are listed below, in
	no particular order.

	* Fixed bugs in drag and drop operations.

	* Applications are launched in the user's home directory if no files
	are specified, and in the directory containing the selected files
	otherwise.

	* Resources are now contained in the Xfm application defaults file,
	to be installed in /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults.

	* A bunch of additional resources for controlling existing and new xfm
	operations; see the Xfm applications default file for details.

	* Check for geometry resource for popups. This allows you to display
	dialog popups in a fixed place, instead of having to chase them
	around the screen.

	* Avoid unecessary folder updates in Move/Copy/Delete operations.

	* Check for identical source and target in move and copy operations.

	* Added an Abort button to the confirmation popup, which allows
	you to kill an operation (like Move, Delete) which may prompt you
	for more than one confirmation.

	* Confirmation for exiting xfm (configurable with the confirmQuit
	resource).

	* Made the -filemgr option work.

	* Prevent applications from locking up xfm with keyboard input. This
	bug was discovered by my four years old son Sebastian when he played
	around with the mouse. ;-)

	* Added overwrite confirmation for the move operation.

	* Added confirmation for removing applications in the applications
	window.

	* Added a status line to the file window which displays number of
	files and total byte size for the displayed directory and selection.

	* Distinguish between directories and other files in the file window
	popup menu.

	* Added a semaphore to prevent the automatic folder updates from
	breaking xfm.

	* Disabled the xfmc stuff. It will possibly be reintegrated in a
	future release. Trashcans and opening windows on floppy devices
	can now be realized easily without xfmc. In fact, the applications
	file distributed with xfm contains examples on how to do this.

	* Added support for color icons in XPM format.

	* Added support for user-defined file types.

	* Distinguish between push and drop actions for launching applications.

	* Allow all types of files to be installed on the application window,
	with proper action settings depending on the file type.

	* Allow actions to prompt for parameters before launching an
	application.

	* Changed the format of the xfm applications files (which is now named
	xfm-apps by default) and added configuration files for file types
	(xfmrc) and devices (xfmdev).

	* Added an autosave feature for application files.

	* Reorganized menus and actions. The file window now has three menus
	(File, Folder and View), and the application menu is accessible as
	a popup by pressing the right mouse button in the application window.
	Pressing the button on an application invokes a popup menu with
	operations for this application, similar to the file window popup.
	This menu contains two new operations for moving and copying
	applications to the bottom of the applications window.

	* Added support for recursive copying and deletion operations (with
	help form Simon Marlow). An extra confirmation resource allows you to
	be prompted before the contents of a directory is removed, in addition
	to the usual delete confirmations.

	* New operations: move/copy a file or a collection of files to a
	specified target (which may be an existing directory). The move
	operation replaces the rename operation in the previous release.
	I also added operations to create a new and empty file, to create
	symbolic links, and to empty the current directory (delete all items
	in it).

	* Added an operation to open a new file window from the application
	window, and allow the last file window to be closed.

	* Made the application and file windows respond to WM_DELETE_WINDOW
	messages.

	* The selection operations now only include . or .. in the selection
	when specified explitly. I also added a Remove button to the
	selections popup which allows you to remove the specified files
	from the selection. The pattern matcher now also understands
	ranges of characters such as [a-z].

	* Added a collection of color icons, and edited existing bitmaps for
	cursors, directories, files, etc. Also designed some icons myself,
	like xfm_appmgr.xpm. Hope you like them. :-)

	* Added a LOAD action to the application manager which allows you to
	load different application files simply by double-clicking on the
	corresponding icon. In effect, this provides support for different
	application groups in the application manager. There is still only
	one applications window, though. :-(

	* Added support for auto-mounting and -unmounting of special file
	systems such as floppies. See the man page for details.

	* Double-clicking on the directory name label in a file window now
	updates the directory display. This is for those of you who are too
	impatient to wait for the automatic folder update to perform its
	task. It is also useful on some special file systems which do not
	always change the time stamp when updating a directory. (I noticed
	this under the msdos file system of Linux.)

	* Added a man page. Quick and dirty job, but it hopefully provides
	all necessary information. In any case, it is better than nothing. ;-)

	* And a plethora of smaller bug fixes (for which I probably
	introduced some new ;-).

Wed Mar 17 00:00:05 1993  system admin  (root@rachel)

	* Updated the README file, included a MANIFEST, and released
	version 1.2.

	* Cleaned up the source, placing xfm and xfmc in subdirectories
	with a top-level Imakefile that knows which things to make.  It
	should still be possible to make in each subdirectory seperately.

Tue Mar 16 19:37:43 1993  system admin  (root@rachel)

	* Placed xfm under the GNU General Public License, added a
	copyright message to files that didn't have one.

	* Lots of minor cleanups and cosmetic changes.  Now compiles with
	virtually no warnings with -Wall -Wno-parentheses.

	* Added an initialDisplayType resource, since there are differing
	opinions as to whether the first window should be of the same type
	as subsequent ones.

	* Incorporated numerous patches from Dave Safford 
	(dave.safford@edu.tamu.sc) including the following: a timeout that
	updates windows when they have changed (by checking the
	timestamp), icons have different names (so they can be assigned
	colours), an edit option for the popup menu, and an option to hide
	files beginning with a '.'.  Also added some new options to
	DEFAULTS to give some colour to the icons, and display the
	application manager on the left of the screen.

Sat Mar  6 23:38:23 1993  system admin  (root@rachel)

	* Added defaultEditor resource.  This is the name of a
	program to be executed when a normal file is double-clicked on.

Fri Mar  5 23:19:05 1993  system admin  (root@rachel)

	* Fixed a major memory leak (failing to free the FileRecs on
	updating a window).  Added function freeFileList() to FmDirs.
	Added some hooks for the debugging malloc library, included when
	DEBUG_MALLOC is defined. (ver 1.1h).

Sun Dec  6 16:48:16 GMT 1992

  * Made some minor cleanups, changed the README file, tested it for about
    20 secs, and released it to a few alpha testers (ver 1.1g).

Fri Oct 16 15:25:42 BST 1992
  
  * New function: newFileWindow in FmFw.c. Replaces a common sequence of lines
    when opening a new file window.

  * Added some checking that the chdir function actually succeeded in
    createFileWindow() - it was failing sometimes when responding to
    messages from the client.

  * fileOpenButtonCb() now pops up windows by the cursor only if it was called
    from FmFwActions.c.

  * Uncommented a line from fileCloseCb() that caused an error in older versions
    of the X toolkit - the widgets could not be destoryed. Xfm should now use
    a lot less memory as this was a major memory leak.

  * Fixed some bugs in the communications module. There are still problems due
    to the event handler being called recursively - this is mainly a problem
    with the error handler which dispatches more events while waiting for the
    user to press 'ok'.

Thu Oct 15 15:44:33 BST 1992
  
  * Removed the function clearUpdateMarks(), and incorporated it into 
    intUpdate().

  * Finally completed the communications module so that arbitrary length
    messages can be sent from the client. It seems to work, but I'm a bit
    dubious.

Wed Oct 14 12:54:37 BST 1992

  * Removed special translations for labels, it messed up the click-drag stuff
    (ie. if you dragged on to a label, xfm got all confused).

  * Finally fixed the problem with symbolic links to non-existent files. 
    Now, you get the directory displayed, and the offending icon(s) are greyed
    out, although they can still be used. You should still get a warning when
    this is happening.

  * I'm getting some strange behaviour, that results in error() being called
    recursively. For now I just ignore any subsequent errors, but I suspect
    this is a bug in the toolkit/server.

  * Removed the freeing of the bitmaps and cursors on exit. This is done by
    the server anyway (apparently).

  * improved the communications module somewhat - it now uses atoms for the two
    message types, to avoid problems with other messages. Still need to allow
    arbitrary length messages. Also - I'm getting an error when using the
    client from another machine.

Tue Oct 13 11:54:18 BST 1992

  * added sys/types.h before sys/stat.h in Fm.h. Removed sys/stat.h from some
    files since it is included in Fm.h anyway. This patch is required for
    Ultrix (apparently), and System V I think.

Mon Oct 12 14:06:05 BST 1992

  * Probably missed out a few more.

  * Fixed fnSub() in FmDirs.c - It was failing due to overlapping areas being
    handled incorrectly by strcpy, to the effect that if HOME was shorter than
    the name of the resource file, it crashed. Thanks to Peter Williams for 
    this one.

  * Fixed FmDelete.c so that it deletes symbolic links properly.

Sat Sep 26 15:20:08 BST 1992

  * I've missed a few out here...
    Added support to handle the ClientMessage event, and either open a new
    window or update some of the existing ones. A small program called xfmc
    to send these signals is included. Currently very hacky, needs some work.

  * Added a signal handler for SIGCHLD that just calls waitpid(), this clears
    up the zombie processes generated by the application manager.

  * Patched in a fix for FmFw.c, when the text display is used and there exists
    a file owned by a user that has no entry in the password file, then it core
    dumped. Thanks to hkarhune@hydra.helsinki.fi for this one.

  * Action fileBeginDrag is now called when leaving the window with the button
    pressed. This solves problems with double clicking (you weren't allowed to
    move the mouse between clicks).

  * Added a floating menu activated by the third button with all the single 
    file operations on it. The operations menu now has only delete and mkdir 
    options. I think it's nicer this way.

  * Scrapped FmIcons.c for now. Looking for a more general solution.

Sat Sep 12 19:35:50 BST 1992

  * Added support for user defined icons in file windows: FmIcons.c. A new
    resource is added (iconMappings).

  * Cursors are now opaque (looks nicer :-)

  * Cursor changes to a no-entry symbol when over a directory that you
    do not have write access to.

  * New function abortXfm() in FmErrors.c for terminal errors during startup.

Thu Sep 10 17:05:49 BST 1992 simonm (simonm@dcs.glasgow.ac.uk)

  * This file added.

  * Moved the 'move' operation to button 1 (press+move to initiate)

  * Added the select operation, put it on button 1. Button 1 now selects the
    file that the mouse is on, and deselects all others. Move defaults to
    select if the mouse doesn't move anywhere usefull.

  * Relegated the old toggle operation to button 2.

  * Added the ability to drag directories onto the root window to open them

  * Modified popupByCursor so that windows are not created half off the
    screen, modulo messing around by the window manager.
