This directory contains a collection of fileicons put together and edited by
Juan D. Martin (juando@cnm.us.es). A sample xfmrc file for this collection is
included as well. Install as follows (assuming that your xfm libdir is
/usr/X11/lib/X11/xfm):

cp bitmaps/* /usr/X11/lib/X11/xfm/bitmaps
cp pixmaps/* /usr/X11/lib/X11/xfm/pixmaps
cp xfmrc /usr/X11/lib/X11/xfm/dot.xfm

Also, xfm users should copy xfmrc to ~/.xfm (or run xfm.install) to replace
their personal xfmrc file with the new one.

Note that the xfmrc file will not work with xfm versions <=1.3.1; it requires
version 1.3.2 (or later).
