This directory contains an alternative xfm setup featuring additional file
types and a collection of 3d-look 32x32 icons taken from the xplore file
manager at http://www.musikwissenschaft.uni-mainz.de/~ag/xplore/ (these, in
turn, are based on icons in the Cica archive and Juan D. Martin's fileicons
collection from previous xfm releases). I think that the new setup looks a lot
better than the original xfm setup from previous releases, see screen.gif for
a screenshot.

To build xfm with it, just make sure that the USE_3DICONS option is enabled in
Imake.options (which it is by default), before you run imake.

Please note that even with the new enhanced CMAP feature (see README-1.4),
this setup may require quite a few colors, so if it eats up too much color
cells on your system, you should disable the USE_3DICONS option.

Enjoy!
